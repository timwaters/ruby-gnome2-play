a number of play scripts using ruby gnome2  http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi

testapplet

put the .server file in /usr/lib/bonobo/servers/

put the ruby file, (example-applet) in /usr/lib/gnome-panel/

Start the ruby file in the dev directory on the console (for debugging) 

click add to panel etc

ctrl-c stops the applet.

testapplet/example-applet reads in the preferences from ~/.gnome2/example-applet

it's a YAML file 

with one line:

date_start: "16-4-2012"

It counts the number of days from the start date. Simple.
